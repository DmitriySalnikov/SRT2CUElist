# SRT2CUElist

This is a simple converter from .srt to .csv cue list.

## Usage

To convert the .srt file(s) just drop it on the executable or specify the list of files as an argument in the console, e.g. `SRT2CUElist.exe "1.srt" "2.srt" "3.srt"`.

The main idea is to export the subtitles from the timeline in Davinci to an srt file, convert them to csv, and import them into Davinci in the ADR section.

I don't know but maybe this is applicable to other programs.
